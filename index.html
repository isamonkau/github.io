                            <p>We're entering a new era where AI systems are evolving from simple question-answering tools to sophisticated digital workers. These aren't your typical chatbots that follow basic scriptsâ€”we're talking about intelligent agents that can tackle complex business challenges by working together, learning from outcomes, and adapting their approach in real time.</p>

                            <h4>What Are AI Agents?</h4>
                            <p>Most people know language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT primarily as chatbots where you ask questions in a chat window. Through prompts like "Act as an expert in..." you can give instructions to an AI model. But this isn't the only way AI models can communicate.</p>
                            <p>LLMs can do much more than generate text when equipped with 'tools.' Think about retrieving information from the internet, entering data into spreadsheets, sending progress updates, or communicating with other AI models. AI agents combine all of these functionalities. Take a content marketing agent: it can conduct market research, identify trending topics, write blog articles, and generate accompanying images.</p>
                            <h4>From AI Agents to Agentic AI</h4>
                            <p>Agentic AI adds layers of complexity and intelligence:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Multi-Agent Collaboration:</strong> Each agent plays a role in a broader plan</li>
                                <li><strong>Task Decomposition:</strong> Breaks complex goals into parallel subtasks</li>
                                <li><strong>Memory Systems:</strong> Episodic and semantic memory to recall outcomes and optimize over time</li>
                                <li><strong>Dynamic Orchestration:</strong> Agents can delegate, negotiate, and even challenge each other's decisions</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This evolution is like going from individual performers to a symphony orchestraâ€”where each AI agent knows its part, but also listens, reacts, and adjusts in real time. In the next article we dive deeper into what this could look like.</p>

                        <img src="n8n2.png" alt="Spotify Advance 3D blue and green waves" />

                    <div id="content-container-vibecoding" class="card-container">
                        <div class="first-paragraph">
                            <p>Most have probably seen the <a href="https://eva.avrotros.nl/artikel/alexander-klopping-laat-zien-hoe-ai-jouw-kantoorbaan-overneemt-we-hebben-marketingbureau-eva-opgericht-624" target="_blank">viral video</a> already: When Alexander Klopping demonstrated 'Agency Eva' on Dutch television's Eva Jinek show, viewers witnessed something unprecedented: a team of AI agents working together like human colleagues to create a complete marketing campaign in real time. What would normally take days of coordination between departments was accomplished in just 10 minutes; including target audience analysis, campaign strategy, and visual content creation.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-vibecoding" class="btn-container">
                                <button id="btn-vibecoding" class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('vibecoding')">Read more</button>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div id="content-vibecoding" class="card-content-hidden">
                            <p>The demonstration wasn't just impressive television; it was a glimpse into the future of how creative work gets done. The heart of Agency Eva consisted of seven specialized AI agents, each with distinct roles and expertise. Such as a campaign director, content expert, creative strategist, copywriter, designer, quality reviewer and social & PR specialist.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Why Multi-Agent Beats Single AI</h4>
                            <p>The power of this approach lies in specialization and focus. While a single AI model might handle simple tasks well, complex creative projects benefit enormously from division of labor.</p>
                            
                            <p>Consider the difference between asking one person to be simultaneously a strategist, copywriter, designer, and reviewer for a major campaign versus having specialists for each role. The same principle applies to AI: when each agent can focus entirely on their core expertise with detailed, specific instructions, the quality of each component dramatically improves.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Live Collaboration Experience</h4>
                            <p>What made the television demonstration particularly compelling was the transparency of the process. Viewers could watch the AI agents communicate with each other in real time through chat messages, seeing exactly how tasks were delegated, confirmed, and completed. This visibility transformed what could have been a mysterious "black box" process into something viewers could understand and follow step-by-step.</p>

                    <div id="content-container-bbc" class="card-container">
                        <p>In a recent interview, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered a vision of advertising's future that should make every marketer sit up and take notice. His message was clear: Traditional ads may be headed for extinction or at least a dramatic reinvention. At the core of this shift is Meta's growing investment in AI-powered assistants that operate within apps like WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>
                        <div id="btn-container-bbc">

                            <p>These bots are designed not just to answer questions but to actively guide users through product discovery and purchase, all within the chat interface. This emerging model moves away from ads as interruptions and toward seamless, AI-driven brand experiences embedded directly in user conversations.</p>
                            <h4>The key takeaways:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>AI as a sales channel:</strong> Brands can engage customers directly through intelligent chatbots that understand preferences, recommend products and facilitate purchases in real time.</li>
                                <li><strong>In-app commerce is central:</strong> This approach reduces friction by keeping the entire customer journey within the app: no redirects, no web pages, just a straight line from interest to purchase.</li>
                                <li><strong>A potential decline in traditional formats:</strong> As conversational commerce grows, standard display and feed-based ads may lose prominence, prompting advertisers to rethink where and how they allocate spend.</li>
                                <li><strong>New creative demands:</strong> Marketers will need to craft compelling conversational experiences, with tone, persona and user flow becoming as important as visuals and copy once were.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The bottom line? This isn't the death of advertising: it's a fundamental redesign. One where AI isn't just a tool behind the scenes, but the face of the brand. For forward-thinking advertisers, this represents both a challenge and a major opportunity: to evolve from creators of messages to designers of experiences.

                        <p>YouTube just announced a subtle yet significant shift in how it serves ads. Rather than sticking to rigid pre-rolls or mid-roll schedules, YouTube will now use AI to identify "peak moments" in videos and place ads immediately after them.</p>
                        <div id="btn-container-agentic">
                            <button id="btn-agentic" class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('agentic')">Read more</button>

                            <p>The goal? Catch viewers when engagement is high, attention is primed and the urge to click away is lowest. What qualifies as a "peak moment"? That's where the machine learning comes in. YouTube's systems analyze things like viewer behavior, video structure and content dynamics to spot the emotional or narrative high points. Once the algorithm finds the sweet spot, it queues up the ad.</p>
                            <h4>Why does this matter for advertisers?</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Contextual timing gets smarter:</strong> Forget interrupting mid-sentence. Ads will now appear at more natural pauses, moments when audiences are more receptive, not resistant.</li>
                                <li><strong>AI drives emotional alignment:</strong> The tech understands content cadence and viewer engagement patterns, helping ads land at just the right moment. Think of it as a soft handoff, not a hard cut.</li>
                                <li><strong>Creative strategy needs to evolve:</strong> With ads arriving post-climax, creative teams may want to rethink pacing, tone and messaging to ride the emotional momentum rather than compete with it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Attention economics in action:</strong> This is another step toward smarter, less intrusive monetization: part of a broader trend of using AI to align ad experiences with user intent and mood.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>YouTube's move hints at a future where AI doesn't just optimize delivery: it choreographs it, syncing brand messaging with viewer emotion in real time. For advertisers, this is an opportunity to show up not louder, but smarter.

                        <p>At Netflix' 2025 Upfront presentation, they've delivered a confident message to advertisers: this isn't just another platform looking to squeeze in more ads, it's positioning itself as the centre of attention in a fragmented media landscape. With 40 million monthly active users now on its ad-supported tier (up from 5 million just a year ago), Netflix is proving that premium content and smart advertising can coexist and even thrive.</p>
                        <div id="btn-container-spotify">
                            <button id="btn-spotify" class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('spotify')">Read more</button>

                        <div id="content-spotify" class="card-content-hidden">
                            <p>Rather than flooding viewers with traditional ad clutter, Netflix is embracing a leaner, more intentional approach. Its model favors fewer, high-quality ad placements delivered in a context viewers actually enjoy. According to Netflix, 70% of ad-supported users are watching more than 10 hours of content per month. The proof that attention, not volume, is the currency that matters.</p>
                            <p>And while AI wasn't front and centre in the presentation, it's quietly becoming foundational to Netflix's strategy. From audience targeting to creative optimization, AI is beginning to shape the way ads are delivered and even how campaigns are conceptualized. It's a sign of what's coming: a future where storytelling and machine intelligence work together to create smarter, more adaptive brand experiences.</p>
                            <p>In short, Netflix is building an advertising environment that respects the viewer, rewards the brand, and leverages technology to enhance, not interrupt, the content journey.

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Text-to-video is getting sophisticated:</strong> This isn't rough animation: it's high-resolution, cinematic-grade storytelling, driven by natural language. That means faster prototyping, on-demand content and limitless variations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Creative agility just levelled up:</strong> Veo empowers creatives to go from concept to visual in minutes. Think storyboards that animate themselves or social campaigns built with near-instant iterations.</li>
                                <li><strong>AI as collaborator, not just tool:</strong> With platforms like Google Flow, AI becomes an active part of the brainstorming process, suggesting edits, styles or narrative angles you might not have considered.</li>
                                <li><strong>Content velocity without creative compromise:</strong> For advertisers, this opens doors to scale high-quality content across channels without blowing through time or budget. Customization, localization and personalization just became easier and way more visually compelling.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The big picture? Google is turning AI into a creative accelerant, not a replacement. These tools won't kill human creativity, it will amplify it. And for forward-thinking marketers, that means turning bold ideas into polished visuals at the speed of thought.</p>

                        <p>Many companies see promising productivity gains from AI, yet struggle to translate these individual successes into broader organizational benefits. Ethan Mollick highlights three essential components to effectively realize AIâ€™s potential: Leadership, Lab, and Crowd. </p>
                        <div id="btn-container-leaders">
                            <button id="btn-leaders" class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('leaders')">Read more</button>

                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Effective AI adoption begins with leadership clearly communicating an engaging vision. Leaders must move beyond generic statements about efficiency and vividly describe how AI will reshape day-to-day work. Employees seek reassurance on job security and clear guidance on how AI-driven productivity gains will impact their roles. Leadership also involves creating incentives for transparent AI usage and modeling practical AI applications actively within their workflows.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lab:</strong> Organizations should establish dedicated teamsâ€”labsâ€”that experiment, innovate, and rapidly iterate with AI tools. Labs translate crowd-sourced ideas into practical solutions, creating benchmarks tailored to company-specific tasks. Quick, iterative experiments help organizations quickly adapt to rapid AI advancements, enabling them to remain at the forefront of innovation. </li>
                            <li><strong>Crowd:</strong> Employeesâ€”the crowdâ€”play a pivotal role by exploring AI through daily tasks, often uncovering practical use cases that centralized strategies might overlook. However, widespread hidden AI use, driven by fear of repercussions or unclear policies, currently undermines potential gains. Companies must actively encourage openness and reward transparency in AI usage, enabling insights from employee experiences to inform broader organizational strategies.</li>
                          </ul>
                            <p>Integrating these three elementsâ€”visionary leadership, agile experimentation through labs, and employee-driven innovationâ€”will enable organizations to not only adopt AI more effectively but to fundamentally transform their operations and maintain competitive advantage. <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/making-ai-work-leadership-lab-and?utm_source=substack&publication_id=1180644&post_id=163976275&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share&triggerShare=true&isFreemail=true&r=43xie4&triedRedirect=true" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>

                        <p>A fascinating Harvard Business School <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/05/why-ceos-should-think-twice-before-using-ai-to-write-messages?ab=HP-hero-featured-1" target="_blank">study</a> at Zapier reveals a striking paradox: while employees could barely distinguish between AI-written and CEO-written messages (only 59% accuracy), they consistently rated messages they believed were AI-generated as less helpful, even when those messages were actually written by humans. This phenomenon is called "authenticity bias".</p>
                        <div id="btn-container-teammate">

                            <p>Researchers created a "Wade Bot" trained on Zapier CEO Wade Foster's communications, which successfully mimicked his writing style. However, the study uncovered a critical insight: perception matters more than performance. When people believed a message came from AI, they found it less valuable, regardless of its actual quality or origin.</p>
                            <p>With 50% of U.S. CEOs already using generative AI for content creation and 75% having used it personally, the technology's adoption is inevitable. The research suggests to be transparent and never rely on AI autonomously.</p>
                            <p>As Wade Foster notes: "When I use gen AI, I decide whether to use what it produces, and I must stand by everything in the message."</p>
                            <p>Something to reflect on: How do you value a message when you know it was written with the help of AI? Would it change your trust in the content, even if the message resonates or feels authentic?</p>
